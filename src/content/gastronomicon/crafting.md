After gathering ingredients, the next step is to turn them into something edible.

## Reading the Guide Recipes

All workstations in Gastronomicon contain an **Ingredients** section, a **Container** section, and a **Tools** section.

The 3x3 recipe shown in the center corresponds to the **Ingredients** section. \
The items in the second-last row correspond to the **Tools** section. \
The item in the last row corresponds to the **Container** section.

Additionally, the guide will tell you whether the recipe is shaped or shapeless in the bottom right corner.

For Multi-Stove recipes, the required temperature of the recipe is shown just above the shapedness indicator.

## Workstations

The **Culinary Workbench** and **Grain Mill** do not require any additional input.

The **Refridgerator** and **Multi-Stove** require energy to craft food and must be connected to an energy network. In addition to energy, the **Multi-Stove** also requires the temperature to be set correctly for each recipe.

The **Fermenter** requires water, which can be refilled by right-clicking it with water buckets (1000 mB) or bottles (333 mB).
