## Crafting

Gastronomicon recipes are crafted using ingredients, tools, and a container. See [Crafting](crafting) for more information.

## Chef's Profile

Your profile can be viewed using the command `/gastronomicon profile` or `/gn profile`. Your profile shows your proficiencies and title.

### Proficiencies

Each time you craft a recipe, your proficiency in that recipe goes up by 1. The more proficient you are at a recipe, the higher the chance of a perfect craft for that recipe (+25% chance max, configurable).

## Electric Machines

The electric versions of Gastronomicon machines must be manned by a Chef Android (placing it in the android slot in the GUI), which must first be trained on specific foods. You can train a Chef Android on a certain recipe when your proficieny in that recipe reaches 256 (configurable).
