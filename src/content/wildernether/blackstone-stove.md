The Blackstone Stove is the main crafting block for Wildernether.

## Usage

When using the correct mode and recipe, clicking on the "Click to cook!" button in the stove's menu will put the cooked item in the output slot.

## Modes

The four modes of the Blackstone Stove are:

### Oven

Oven mode is the default mode for a Blackstone Stove. Simply right-click the stove and start cooking!

### Frying

To use the frying mode, place a Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate (Iron Pressure Plate) on top of the stove.

### Pot

Similarly, place a Cauldron on top of the stove to use its pot mode. Most pot recipes will need a container such as a bowl to go into the container slot.

### Brewing

Finally, place a Light Weighted Pressure Plate (Gold Pressure Plate) to use the brewing mode. Like the pot, brewing recipes need a bottle of water in the container slot. Since water is hard to come by in the Nether, you can substitute it with Cactus Juice!

## Reading the Stove recipes

The middle six slots in the stove menu correspond the the top six slots in the guide recipe. The leftmost slot is for containers for the recipes that need them.
