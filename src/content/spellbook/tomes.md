title: Tomes
---

Tomes contain 4-5 spells, and must be held in the offhand slot to use. With a tome in the offhand and a staff in the mainhand, you can start inputting commands to cast a spell. Shift right-clicking with a tome will show all the spells it contains, as well as their mana costs, cooldowns, and affinities.
